# Breaking Bad Project

This project gives information about all the characters in one of my favourite Web-Series "The Breaking Bad" and displays information about each character in a flip-card.

Also it filters the characters as we search for particular ones

## Lessons Learned

This project is made using functional component and Hooks is used heavily in this project. Particularly useState and useEffect and axios module(fetch from api) and also working with api becomes more handy by making this project

And the api request sent makes a little bit of time to respond so i made sure to use a loader...and making a animated loader screen manually is tough so i faced some difficulty there.
